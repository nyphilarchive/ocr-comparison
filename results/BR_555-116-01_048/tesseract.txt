Step in Cutting the Budget
for Military Spending

$1.3-BILLION WAS SPENT

Including:Similar Vehicle

By JOHN W. FINNEY

Special fo Tf New York Times

WASHINGTON, June 10—|
The Defense Department, after|
spending $1,3-billion on the
project, canceled today the Air
Force's manned orbiting lab-
oratory program as “a major|

ste toward reducing the
military budget.
In a statement read by

Deputy Defense Secretary!
David Packard at a Pentagon|
news conference, the Defense
Department said the principal
reason for canceling the Air|
Force’s manned space flight
program was the “urgency of|
reducing Federal defense
spending.”

The cancellation was an-|
nounced shortly before the:
House, by a 328-to-52 roll-call
vote, approved legislation au-
thorizing a $3.9-billion budget
for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration in
‘he coming fiscal year. About|
half the money would go. for|
manned space flight, including
development of a manned
orbiting laboratory similar to
the one being worked on inde-|
pendently by the Air Force.

Amendment Rejected

WASHINGTON, June 10 —
The Judicial Conference of the
United States laid down stiff
new rules today that forbid
all Federal judges except mem-|
bers of the Supreme Court to|
accept outside fees.

The rules also require all
lower Federal judges to file
annual reports of their invest-
ments and other assets.

said Robert A, Ainsworth Jr.,

Mayor Lindsay, who read the|
joint statement of the two|
mayoral candidates at a City’

response to questions, “I don’t
wish to make any specific ref-

Mr. Badillo, however, said in|
a telephone interview that he
was “talking specifically about
the advertisements of Robert F.
Wagner.”

Paul R.Screvane, Mr. Wagner’s|

statement.

“Why do these two particular}
candidates speak out together?"
Mr, Screvane asked through a
