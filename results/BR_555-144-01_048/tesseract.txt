‘The Bronx is not all burned-out blocks
of no man’s land occasionally visited by
politicians on ghoul-trips. Even in the
South Bronx, where the devastation is
concentrated, people are busy trying to
keep their cultures and some kind of art
and growing. ‘The North Bronx,
around Bedford Boulevard, where
little hills and big trees give a feeling of
substantial, middle-class suburbia, must
have had an easier cultural time of it, but

The Manzoni Requiem has frequently been de-
scribed as Giuseppe Verdi's best opera, but in
Wednesday's New York Philharmonic Pension Fund
concert, it appeared that the Requiem was going to
be the only Verdi opera sung by Metropolitan Opera
soloists here in the foreseeable future. The Met is
locked out, but at least in the stellar solo quartet
provided, it gave the sell-out audience (and millions
who experienced it via simulcast) an inspiring and

At least that is how it looked on paper,
even if the results turned out to be
something less than spectacular.

For all that it was not much more
than a brief throat-clearer, the opening
Susato suite was the most interesting
entry of the evening. Orchestral con-
certs rarely offer music written before
1700 for the simple reason that little of of
it suits today's large halls and ensem-

‘Resume Negotiations

By JOHN ROCKWELL

| Negotiations resumed

| morning between the Metropolitan

| Opera and-its orchestra, and continued
in the afternoon, leading to a sudden
hope that the dispute that has darkened
the nation's leading opera company
might still be resolved.

Meetings resumed at the Doral Inn
after both sides had been called to-
gether by Wayne L. Horvitz, director of
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service. I. Philip Sipser, lawyer for the
musicians, had said his side would not
return to the bargaining table without
some indication the Met was willing to
consider the “legitimacy” of the or-
chestra's proposal for a four-perform-
ance workweek.

Yesterday Mr. Sipser's “we are talk-
ing” sounded guardedly optimistic; be-
fore, both sides had described the ses-
sions as little more than the presenta-
tion of incompatible demands.

The Met and the musicians refused
comment on the negotiations, in re-
‘sponse to a request by Mr. Horvitz. But
it was learned that the talks were be-
tween the Met and the musicians, and

its moment in the sun and this music,
after all, was intended to be relished,

Of course there was Mr. Milstein, for
many years a formidable interpreter of
the Tchaikovsky warhorse, which he
endows with a patrician elegance and a
noble eloquence that erases all traces
entimentality from the score. He
may not command the notes with all
the virtuoso brilliance of yore, but his
technique is still quite miraculous and
his musical insights remain consis

This is not meant to take away credit from the
superb work of the Westminster Choir or the Philhar-
monic’s inspired playing under the direction of
Zubin Mehta. It was just that in the extended
standing ovation at the end, the biggest roars went to
the singers we have already missed too long—
soprano Montserrat Caballe, mezzo Bianca Berin|,
tenor Placido Domingo and bass Paul Plishka—all of

contracts with the company. Tradition-
ally at the Met, it has been the orches-
tra that has set the pattern for the other
unions, and so far this year, the other
unions, although reportedly close to a
settlement, have refused to sign until
they saw what the orchestra obtained.

The two sides had not met since talks
broke down Oct. 5, following President
Carter's request that Mr. Horvitz at-
tempt again tosettle the dispute.

On Sept. 29, The company canceled
its 1980-81 season, which had been
scheduled to begin Sept. 22. Before
that, it had locked out all its 1,900 em-
ployees before the beginning of the re.

jearsal period on Sept, 2, saying it
would not pay the $1 million rehearsal
costs when there was the threat of a
strike

The principal issue this year has
been the orchestra's request for a four-
performance workweek. The orchestra
wishes a reduction of one peformance
played by each musician a week, which
would bring its work schedule closer to
that of major symphony orchestras.
The Met has steadfastly insisted it
could not afford the request, although
the orchestra has indicated it would be
willing to “pay for" the work reduction
by accepting a'smaller wage increase.
