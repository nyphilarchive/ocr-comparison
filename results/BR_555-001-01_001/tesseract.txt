MUAST PHILHARMONIC CONCERT.

‘The eighth and last public rehearsal and ||
concert of the PhiJharmonle Society will
be given cn Friday afternoon (March 25)
and Saturday evening, (March 26.) Richard
Strauss will be the conductor, and for the
tirst time in New York he will direct an
important ordhestral work not of his own
composition. The opening number of his
programme will be Mozart's Symphony in
© major, “Jupiter.” Inside of six weeks
in the Summer of 1788 Mozart wrote his
three greatest symphonies, those in B flat,

minor, and C major, Of all his many

phonies, these three are the only ones
which cam be said to be familiar to the
public, or even to ‘musicians, though of
late efforts have been made to restore
some of the other symphonies to the active
Ust. In the catalogue of his works which
Mozart kept after the year 1784, the first
of these symphonies is entered under date
of June 25, the second under July 25, and
the third under Aug. 10. Critics and an-
alysts have all but exhausted their vocab
ularies in their efferts to do justice to this
masterplece of the imagination and learn-
ing. Herman Kretzschmar said: “ In‘many
respects it may be considered Mozart's |
greatest achievement in the symphonic |
field, and it constitutes one of the most
‘beautiful monuments in existence to his
free, strong, and opulen¢ intellect. No other ,

symphony of Mozart’s has this broad the-
matic Sweep, no other one unites such

wealth of really. golden ideas with such

unity cf character and harmony of repre-

sentation. Something of the antique lives

in it; a lofty joyousness and a sense of

beauty which ‘eunobles even its wildest

outbursts of merriment. S

Groye declares that “the sobriquet

‘Jupiter,’ which has been bestowed on this

noble work, well expresses the estimate of |
a former generation as to the position
which, in its calm, lofty, Godlike beauty, it |
