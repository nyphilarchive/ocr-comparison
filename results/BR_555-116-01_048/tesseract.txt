PENTAGON DROPS
AIR FORCE PLANS
FOR ORBITING LAB

Cancellation Is Called Major
Step in Cutting the Budget
for Military Spending

$1.3-BILLION WAS SPENT

House Votes $3.9-Billion for
NASA Space Programs,
Including:Similar Vehicle

By JOHN W. FINNEY

‘Special fa THe Svew ork Times

WASHINGTON, June 10—|
The Defense Department, after|
spending $1,3-billion on the
project, canceled today the Air
Force's manned orbiting lab-
oratory program as “a major

step” toward reducing the
military budget.

In a statement read by|
Deputy Defense Secretary

David Packard at a Pentagon!
news conference, the Defense
Department said the principal
reason for canceling the Air|
Force's manned space flight
program was the “urgency of
reducing Federal defense
spending.”

The cancellation was an-|
nounced shortly before the
House, by a 328-to-52 roll-call
vote, approved legislation au-|
thorizing a $3.9-billion budget
for the National Aeronautics
nd Space Administration in
ie coming fiscal year. About
half the money would go. for
manned space flight, including
development of a manned
orbiting laboratory similar to|
the one being worked on inde-
pendently by the Air Force.

LINDSAY, BADILLO

Democtat Points to Wagner,

By MARTIN TOLCHIN

Mayor Lindsay and Bronx!
Borough President Herman Ba-|
dillo yesterday assailed “some
candidates” whose advertise-|
ments appealed to “suspicion!
and fear,” and asked all can
didates to repudiate such ap-
peals.

Mayor Lindsay, who read the}
joint statement of the two)
mayoral candidates at a City)
Hall news conference, said in)
response to questions, “I don’t}
wish to make any specific ref-
erence to any candidate or any
advertisement.

Mr. Badillo, however, said in|
a telephone interview that he|
was “talking specifically about
the advertisements of Robert F.
Wagner.”

Paul R.Screvane,Mr. Wagner's
campaign manager, promptly|
assailed the Badillo-Lindsay)
statement.

“why do these two particular
candidates speak out together?”
Mr, Screvane asked through a
press spokesman. “If they did
not see partisan advantage to
themselves, they might well
have asked all those who share
the viewpoint to join in such|
a. statement.

“Of particular significance is
the Badillo-Lindsay tie-up. We
have Jong known that Mayor
Lindsay wants Mr, Procaccino}
