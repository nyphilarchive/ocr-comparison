December 16, 1960
Mr. Al Manuti, President
Local 802, A.F. of M.
261 West 52nd Street
New York 19, N. Y.
Dear Al:
We made plans some months ago for a Pension Fund Concert
to be given on February 13, 1961. It has been put together
as "A Valentine for Leonard Bernstein," with all music by
Bernstein.
In the first half of the program Isaac Stern, Jennie Tourel,
Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss and Thomas Schippers are perform-
ing, and in the second half Comden and Green, ballet dancers,
Rosalind Russell and others - all contributing their services
for the benefit of the Orchestral Pension Fund.
February 13th falls on a Monday, and we therefore need to
find out as soon as possible whether the Orchestra will
rehearse and play on that Monday. It was our understanding
when this was scheduled that there was to be a "free day"
per week, and the following day Tuesday, February 14th,
has been kept entirely free.
With this concert, there would be three Pension Fund Concerts
this season. Since the Orchestra plays only two without fee,
the third concert would obviously be paid for extra.
I would very much appreciate your letting me know as soon as
possible whether this concert can take place. It is the only
date when the artists and the hall are available, so it will
mean complete cancellation if it cannot be given on February 13th.
With all best regards,
Sincerely yours,
/signed/
